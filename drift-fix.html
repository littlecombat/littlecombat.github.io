    <h1 id="anchor-drift">drift fix</h1>

    <p style="color:#fff;margin-left:20px">
      The Nintendo Switch Joy Con controller, while a unique and arguably revolutionary design in terms of console portability, was developed with a myriad of problems that has plagued the Nintendo playerbase with frustration ever since the console was launched. The most notorious of these problems is referred to as “joystick drift” — a phenomenon that occurs when the internal components of the joystick wear down, and the sensors begin to read input that registers beyond the deadzone of the controller.
      <br><br>
      In other words, the controllers move when you don’t want them to.
      <br><br>
      Fixing drift issues in Joy Con controllers involves replacing components inside the shell itself. All of my repairs include new parts, callibration, and routine interior cleaning to ensure long-lasting playability. If you are also having issues with your Joy Con contollers staying secured to your console, I am happy to replace your plastic controller locks with durable metal locks for an additional fee.

    <h1 id="anchor-delivery">method of delivery</h1>

    <p style="color:#fff;margin-left:20px">
      I am located in Chino, California, and I am happy to service your repairs in the most convenient way possible. I’m offering two methods of service, detailed below:
      <br><br>
      DROP-OFF
      <br><br>
      If you live nearby in the Los Angeles / San Bernardino area, I would be happy to coordinate a local drop-off that is accessible for both of us. When you contact me with details of your repair, just mention that you’d like to meet up locally, and we’ll both save some cash in shipping costs.
      <br><br>
      SHIPMENT
      <br><br>
      For anyone else that would like to repair their Joy Con controllers, please contact me with your location, and we can coordinate shipments in order to complete your repair. If you are able to pack and ship your controllers (or Switch Lite console for Lite repairs), then I will be happy to complete the service and ship your items back to you. Keep in mind, I charge an additional $5 for shipping costs on my end.
      <br><br>
